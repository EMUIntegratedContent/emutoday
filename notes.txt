Needed to increase the php.ini's memory_limit to 256M to process JPG images with high resolution.
There was an image that was only 1.9MB in size, but 700dpi.
For local dev, created custom_php.ini file in the root of the project with memory_limit = 256M.
It is included in the Dockerfile.

PHP 8.3 + Laravel 11 UPGRADE NOTES 2024

Replace with spatie/laravel-html

Intervention\Image Upgrade Notes 8/16/24
1. Upgraded the package intervention\image from v2 to v3.

2. Removed the file config/imagecache.php
This was the config file for the now-defunct intervention\imagecache package.

3. Removed all filter classes and the directory Today\Filters

4. Created a route in routes.php: imagecache/{template}/{filename}
This closely mimics how the defunct plugin worked. No src tags should have to be changed anywhere in the system.

5. Created a controller to resolve the route, cache and return the image.
Http\Controllers\ImageCacheController.php

6. Created a service to apply the filters to the image. All filters that were in Today\Filters are included here (except some that weren't used anywhere).
Services\ImageCacheService.php
